# Dotconfigs

Personal repository for keeping my configuration files for:

- .vimrc
- .bashrc
- .xinitrc
- .Xresources
- i3
- i3status

Vim plugins:
- [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
- [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline): `git clone https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline ~/.vim/bundle/vim-airline`
- [vim-airline-themes](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline-themes): `git clone https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline-themes ~/.vim/bundle/vim-airline-themes`
- [seti.vim](https://github.com/trusktr/seti.vim): `git clone https://github.com/trusktr/seti.vim ~/.vim/bundle/seti.vim`

I also included some of the fonts for icons in i3status.
