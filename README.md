# DotConfigs

Personal repository for keeping my configuration files for:

- .bashrc
- i3
- i3status
- .vimrc

The .bashrc is mostly the default Ubuntu 16.04 .bashrc file.

Vim plugins:
- [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
- [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline)

I also included some of the fonts I included to the system.
